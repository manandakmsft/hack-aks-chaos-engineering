# Challenge 06 - Rearchitecting the application deployment to make it more reliable & resilient against failures

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-05.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** 

## Introduction

In this challenge based on the observations/learning we got from injecting controlled faults into the application & AKS nodes, we will re design the application/deployment to make it more resilient against failures.
