# Hack- Chaos Engineering in AKS using Azure Chaos Studio

## Introduction

As monolithic applications evolved into microservices deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), they introduced new challenges impacting application reliability. Scenarios such as Availability Zone (AZ) outages, nodes under high CPU, memory, or disk I/O pressure, network latency, or DNS resolution failures can all significantly affect application performance and availability.

To ensure resilience, it’s critical to proactively validate these applications by injecting controlled faults into AKS using Azure Chaos Studio.

In this hack, you will gain hands-on experience with Azure Kubernetes Service—deploying workloads/applications on AKS and leveraging Azure Chaos Studio. You’ll design and run chaos experiments that simulate real-world failure scenarios, helping you measure application resiliency, uncover weaknesses, and re-engineer workloads for improved reliability.
